# portfolio-project

The idea from this design started from watching this video from<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_hYR53r61M&list=LL&index=1&t=689s"> Traversy Media / Dennis Ivy</a>

I changed the layout of the page so all of the information would fit inside of the computer UI window, with navigation on the sidebar.

JavaScript controls the html on the right side of the "window" as the navigation links are clicked.
